# ratemyprofessor-chrome-addon

Working on creating a useful chrome addon that allows for the user to highlight a professor's name and have their ratemyprofessor scores pop up alongside it

This allows students to be more cognizant when picking their classes, especially if they're forced to choose the lesser of two evils during registration.

This is my first time working with Javascript and Chrome-specific addons, so I hope it goes well!
